####This project is a mess; embarassing, quite frankly. It is currently undergoing a full rewrite to make it somewhat easier to work with, as well as an overhaul of the keyword selection algorithm to increase performance on that front, and possibly a port to <?hh making use of some of HipHop's awesome features.

Documentation was coming, but I'd honestly rather only document this thing once, and the sweeping changes I'm about to make to it will mean any documentation I write today will be outdated by the time I tag the first release. Instead, I'll be writing the documentation alongside the new codebase, so everything is ready at once.

What that means, essentially, is that this project shouldn't be used for anything at this time. It was a proof of concept and I think it's proven the viability of that concept quite well; it has also revealed some flaws in my initial idea and provided me with a new direction. I'm confident that we'll all like what eventually ends up in this space.
